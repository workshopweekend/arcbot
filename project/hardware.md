You'll need the following components:

* 2 small (standard) servo motors, like [these from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1143).
* 2 Linear Potentiometers, like [these from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/562) or [these from Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=2118791).
* Solderless breadboard.
* Two wooden dowels (round rods).
* Electrical tape.
* Clothespin.
* Felt-tip pen.
* Zipties (optional).
* Hot glue gun (optional).

Additionally, you'll need something to mount your drawing medium on, such as MDF (medium-density fiberboard), likely available at your local hardware or art supply store.

## Mechanical

0. Make sure your servos are in the middle of their range.

1. Pick a large plastic horn (these probably came with your servo) and screw it into your servo.

2. Attach one end of each dowel to each servo by wrapping the dowel and the attached plastic horn with electrical tape. Use zipties for greater strength.

3. Mount one motor on your base; attach the second motor to the first motor's dowel, again using electrical tape and/or zipties.

4. Attach the clothespin to the end of the second motor's dowel.

Get creative with this project! The general idea is to have two motors on sticks, one attached to the other. For some pictures, see [Pete Prodoehl's setup of the original Arc-o-Matic](http://rasterweb.net/raster/projects/arcomatic/).
