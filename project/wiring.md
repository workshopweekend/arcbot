1. Build this circuit:

    ![Two potentiometers, connected to pins A0 and A1](two-potentiometers-fritzing.png)

2. Connect the two servo motors to your Arduino: the two brown (ground) wires should be connected to GND, the two red (power) wires to 5V, and the two orange (signal) wires to digital pins 9 and 10.
